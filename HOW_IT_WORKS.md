# 🏇 How the Horse Race Works

## Simple Setup

```
HORSE A 🐴 ──────────────────────────────────────► FINISH
         [Starts at 0 seconds]

HORSE B 🐎 ──────────────────────────────────────► FINISH
         [Starts at 2 seconds]

HORSE C 🦄 ──────────────────────────────────────► FINISH
         [Starts at 4 seconds]
```

## What Happens

### 1. Players Join
- Everyone scans QR code
- Enters their name
- System randomly assigns them to Horse A, B, or C

### 2. Start Race
- Click "Start Race" button
- 3... 2... 1... countdown

### 3. Staggered Start
```
Time 0s:  Gate opens for Horse A 🐴 - Team A starts tapping!
Time 2s:  Gate opens for Horse B 🐎 - Team B starts tapping!
Time 4s:  Gate opens for Horse C 🦄 - Team C starts tapping!
```

### 4. TAP TO WIN!
- **Every player has a GIANT tap button on their phone**
- **All taps from the same team make the same horse go faster**
- **More players tapping = faster horse**
- **Stop tapping = horse slows down (friction)**

### 5. First to Finish Wins
- Winner is determined by fastest time from THEIR start
- So Horse C can still win even though they started last!

## Example Game

**10 Players Join:**
- Horse A: 4 players (Sarah, Mike, John, Lisa)
- Horse B: 3 players (Tom, Emma, Alex)
- Horse C: 3 players (Rachel, David, Chris)

**Race Starts:**
```
0s:  🐴 Horse A gate opens → 4 players start tapping
2s:  🐎 Horse B gate opens → 3 players start tapping
4s:  🦄 Horse C gate opens → 3 players start tapping
```

**Everyone taps frantically!**
- Each tap moves the horse forward 0.15%
- Horse naturally slows down, so must keep tapping
- Real-time stats show each team's total taps

**Results:**
- Horse A: 15.2 seconds (from their start)
- Horse B: 14.8 seconds (from their start) ← WINNER!
- Horse C: 16.1 seconds (from their start)

**Horse B wins** even though they started 2 seconds late because they tapped more efficiently!

## Why Staggered Start?

This teaches the **Transaction Priority** concept:
- Some transactions (Horse A) get processed immediately
- Others (Horse B, C) have to wait their turn
- But with enough processing power (tapping), later transactions can still finish fast!

## Tips for Players

✅ **TAP AS FAST AS YOU CAN**
✅ **Don't stop tapping - horses slow down!**
✅ **Coordinate with your team**
✅ **Watch the main screen to see your progress**

## Tips for Presenters

🎤 **Narrate the race:**
- "Horse A takes off!"
- "Gate opening for Horse B... NOW!"
- "Horse C starting late but look at those taps!"
- "Horse B making a comeback!"

🎓 **Connect to technology:**
- "Notice how Horse A started first - that's priority transactions"
- "Every tap is processing power in the system"
- "Horse C started last but can catch up with aggressive tapping"

**That's it! Simple, fun, and educational!** 🏇
